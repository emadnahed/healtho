# **Nutrient Calculator App**

Welcome to the Nutrient Calculator App, a React-based application that helps users calculate the nutrients of their meals based on the ingredients they select.

## **Overview**

This application allows users to select ingredients and calculates the total nutrients, including calories, protein, fat, and carbohydrates, of their meal. The app provides a user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to input their ingredients and get instant results.

## **Features**

## **Technical Details**

* **Frontend** : The app is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **Routing** : The app uses React Router for client-side routing, allowing users to navigate between different sections of the app.
* **State Management** : The app uses the `useState` hook to manage state and update the nutrient calculations in real-time.

## **Components**

* **App.js** : The main application component that sets up the routing configuration and renders the layout.
* **Home.js** : The component that renders the home page, where users can select ingredients and view their nutrient calculations.
* **All.js** : The component that renders the all ingredients page, where users can view a list of all available ingredients.
* **Layout.js** : The component that provides a common layout for both the home and all ingredients pages.
* **Card.js** : A reusable component that displays individual ingredients and their corresponding nutrient information.
